## History of Linux

### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux

**Linux** began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student **Linus Torvalds**: to create a new free operating system kernel. The resulting **Linux kernel** has been marked by constant growth throughout its history. Since the initial release of its **source code** in 1991, it has grown from a small number of _C_ files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 with more than 23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments, under the **GNU General Public License v2**.

### The creation of Linux

In 1991, while studying ***computer science*** at **University of Helsinki**, Linus Torvalds began a project that later became the ***Linux kernel***. He wrote the program specifically for the hardware he was using and independent of an operating system because he wanted to use the functions of his new PC with an 80386 processor. Development was done on MINIX using the **GNU C Compiler***.
